# lib/

I have not included Sencha Touch in this repository. The steps to include it are

1. Download Sencha Touch 2 from the [Sencha Website](http://www.sencha.com/products/touch/download/)
2. Unpack the SDK and move it to the `lib/touch2` directory (so you should have a `lib/touch2/sencha-touch-debug.js` file).
3. Open `index-debug.html`
